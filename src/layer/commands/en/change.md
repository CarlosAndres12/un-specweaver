# /sw:change — new requirement mid-development

This is the case that breaks most often when done by feel. **The order is not negotiable.**

The requirement comes in `$ARGUMENTS`. If empty, ask for it before doing anything.

## Step 1 — Scope control (before touching a single file)

Read `.un-specweaver/trace.json` and the PRD. And before classifying, **look at the history of
the requirement it touches**:

```
npx un-specweaver history            # ranking: which requirements changed most, and how much
npx un-specweaver history FR-21      # everything decided, changed or discarded about that FR
```

It crosses the `.memlog.md` files BMAD writes while conversing (decisions, changes, discards with
their reason), the `sprint-change-proposal-*.md` files and the bridge history. If what is being
asked **was already discarded**, say so with the entry and its reason before reopening it:
reopening a decision without knowing it existed is the most expensive way to lose time. An FR with
many changes is an FR nobody understands the same way; if that is the case, say so too.

Classify the requirement as exactly **one** of:

| Classification | How to recognize it | What follows |
|---|---|---|
| **In scope** | refines an existing FR; adds no new behavior | Step 2 |
| **Scope creep** | new behavior the PRD does not cover, but it fits an existing epic | **Stop and say so.** Wait for a decision. |
| **New epic** | a whole new capability | **Stop.** This goes back to planning, it is not a patch. |

State the classification out loud, citing the specific FR or story that backs it. If torn between
two, pick the more restrictive one and explain why.

**Measure the impact on the real code, not the imagined one.** If `graphify-out/graph.json` exists,
run `graphify affected "<module or symbol the requirement touches>"` and report what depends on it:
an "in scope" that drags five modules along is not that in scope. If there is no graph,
`graphify update .` builds it in seconds; if graphify is missing, say so and carry on.

**Do not move to Step 2 without user confirmation for anything other than "in scope".**

## Step 2 — Update the source document, not the derived one

If behavior changes, change the PRD/epics with `bmad-correct-course`.

Editing the spec without updating the PRD leaves both lying: the spec says one thing, the PRD
another, and in three weeks nobody knows which wins. The spec is **derived** from epics.md — it
gets regenerated, not hand-edited.

## Step 3 — Regenerate only what is affected

```
npx un-specweaver bridge --only <N.M> --force
```

One `--only` per touched story. **Do not regenerate everything**: you would overwrite in-flight
changes other developers are already working on.

The bridge knows it is regenerating, not creating:

- if the change exists and is in progress, it **keeps the checked boxes** in `tasks.md` and tells
  you which were lost because the task text changed
- if the requirement is **already archived** (lives in `openspec/specs/`), it emits
  `## MODIFIED Requirements` in a new change `<id>-r2`, `-r3`… — the previous one stays in
  `archive/`. It reuses the archived scenario names because OpenSpec demands them; the content
  is updated
- if the story **dropped** an archived scenario, the bridge **fails and writes nothing**: OpenSpec
  does not allow removing it in a `MODIFIED`. Follow the instruction it prints (keep the criterion,
  or a manual `## REMOVED Requirements` change archived before regenerating). Do not patch by hand
- `trace.json` is merged: stories you did not touch keep their entry
- every run lands in `.un-specweaver/changelog.jsonl`: the history of what was regenerated when

Before running it, check `.un-specweaver/sprint-plan.md`: if the affected story has dependents in
later waves, name which ones are impacted.

## Step 4 — Re-verify

```
npx @fission-ai/openspec validate --all --strict
```

## Step 5 — Record the why

Engram is **optional**, and its memory is **always scoped per project**: `.engram/config.json`
pins the name it saves under and searches in. What you store here does not show up in other
projects, and theirs does not show up here, unless you explicitly ask for a cross-project search
(`all_projects`). Do not do that by default: another project's memory slipping in as if it were
this one's is a hallucination with a citation. If `mem_current_project` does not return
`project_source: "config"`, the binding is missing — run `npx un-specweaver init` before saving.

- **If `engram` is on PATH** → store the decision and its reason there.
- **If it is not** → write it anyway, in the change's `design.md` under `## Decisions`, and
  **tell the user** it went there because Engram is not installed.

What is not acceptable is invoking Engram, nothing happening, and losing the rationale silently.
A "why" that ends up written nowhere is lost just as if it had never been thought.

Store the **decision and its reason**, not the what (that is already in the spec).
What always gets lost is why a scope change was accepted or rejected.

If the change was rejected as scope creep, record it anyway: next time someone proposes it, that
decision saves the entire discussion.
